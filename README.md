"# Student_Performance_DS_Project" 
🎯 Student Exam Performance Predictor

This project predicts a student's Math score based on other exam-related features.
The goal is to help educators and students understand performance patterns and identify areas of improvement.

🎯 Just completed and deployed my new Data Science project — “Student Performance Prediction System”! 🚀

In this project, I built a complete end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline that predicts a student’s Math Score 📊 based on various features such as gender, parental education, lunch type, and test preparation course.

💡 What I did:

Designed a data ingestion → transformation → model training pipeline using Python 🐍

Implemented EDA, preprocessing, and feature scaling with Scikit-learn

Trained multiple ML models — Random Forest, CatBoost, XGBoost, Linear Regression, and Gradient Boosting

Used R² Score for evaluation to select the best model

Created a simple Flask web interface for real-time predictions

Logged and tracked all model training activities using custom logging modules

Exported the trained model (model.pkl) and preprocessor (preprocessor.pkl) for production

🎬 Tech Stack:
Python | Flask | Pandas | NumPy | Scikit-learn | CatBoost | XGBoost | Git | VS Code

✨ Key Learnings:

How to structure a complete ML project folder professionally

Importance of data preprocessing and model selection

Experience with pipeline building, logging, and exception handling

Building an interactive Flask-based web interface for ML apps

I’m truly proud of how far I’ve come on my Data Science journey. 🚀
Would love to hear your feedback or suggestions on improving this project! 💬
